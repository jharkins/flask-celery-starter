# Celery and Flask Learning Repository

This repository contains my code and resources as I work through the course "The Definitive Guide to Celery and Flask." The primary goal is to learn how to integrate Celery, an asynchronous task queue, with Flask, a Python-based web framework, for managing background tasks and improving application performance.

## About the Course

I didn't write the course - I just found it online and found it useful. The book covers the basics of Celery and producer/consumer-based task queues in general. By the end of the book, the reader is expected to be able to:

- Explain why they may want to use a task queue like Celery
- Describe the basic producer/consumer model and how it relates to Celery
- Implement Celery in a Flask application to handle background tasks
